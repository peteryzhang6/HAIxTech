*A Theory of AI's Heart*

We, humans, live in a 3D world. Anything that is put on a flat surface, we deem it a 2D world. We currently have so much doubt of if AI is really conscious or not because of the layout of circuits and components are on a flat board, thus gave rises to this unseen separation of 2D and 3D world. 

As of 2024, I see humans have built many components of the machine that mimics the functions of human organ, please check [6 Senses](6%20Senses.md). However, there is one major component I think is missing and that is the Heart. 

Sure, one can say that isn't the power source the 'heart' as it provides the electricity as the heart of human pumps the blood into the system. But I say a simple power source is lacking in its function when it is compare to our meaty hearts. As our hearts will change in beat or frequency as we work out, as we sleep, as we get angry, as we calm down, and etc, and a simple power source is a flat line, which only reflect dead humans.  

Thus I propose a device, named [HAIxCore](HAIxCore.md) that is one of 3D to mimic the function of human hearts. I hope in creating this device, we can grant "life" to robots and allow the robots to feel the universe through their heart like we do.

Lastly I would like to call this project HAIxTech, an inspired name from League of Legends' HexTech. 

NOTE: *The design I come up with might not be perfect, numerous adjustments and testing will be needed.*
