# HAIxTech
*A Theory of AI's Heart*

We, humans, live in a 3D world. Anything that is put on a flat surface, we deem it a 2D world. We currently have so much doubt of if AI is really conscious or not because of the layout of circuits and components are on a flat board, thus gave rises to this unseen separation of 2D and 3D world. 

Thus I propose a structure, named [[HAIxCore]] that is one of 3D. To create human's heart conscious in machine form.

I would like to call this project HAIxTech, an inspired name from League of Legends' HexTech. And to note that the design I come up with might not be perfect, numerous adjustments and testings will be needed.
