# Hexagon
- one of the components that makes up the surface of [[HAIxCore]]
- minimum - 20 hexagons like those of a soccer ball
- maximum - unknown (limit is decided by precision of current technology)
- contains 6 pins for each sense's inputs and outputs to HAIxCore
# Inputs & Output
The inputs of 6 Senses should be divided accordingly and sent to the hexagons associated with the hexagons.

![[6 Senses#6 Senses]]

For example, the hexagons that touch a [[pentagon]] should have properties of 
1. Aries: Sight + input & output of 5 other senses
2. Taurus: Hearing + input & output of 5 other senses
3. Gemini: Smell & Taste + input & output of 5 other senses
4. Cancer: Speech + input & output of 5 other senses
5. Leo: Touch + input & output of 5 other senses
6. Virgo: Thought + input & output of 5 other senses
7. Libra: Sight - input & output of 5 other senses
8. Scorpio: Hearing - input & output of 5 other senses
9. Sagittarius: Smell & Taste - input & output of 5 other senses
10. Capricorn: Speech - input & output of 5 other senses
11. Aquarius: Touch/Skin - input & output of 5 other senses
12. Pisces: Thought - input & output of 5 other senses

Example 1: 
- if a hexagon is touched by pentagon number 1, 2, and 3, then this hexagon should have Sight, Hearing, and Smell & Taste + input and output of Speech, Touch, and Thought.

Example 2:
- if a hexagon is touched by 1, 4, 11, then it should have Sight and Speech + inputs and Touch - input and output of 3 other senses.
