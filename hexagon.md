# Hexagon
- minimum - 20 hexagons like those of a soccer ball
- maximum - unknown (limit is decided by precision of current technology)
- contains 6 pins for each sense's inputs and outputs to HAIxCore
- contains 1 pin for consistent outgoing voltage from the 12 [[pentagon]]s to Battery
## Inputs & Output
The inputs of [[6 Senses]] should be divided accordingly and sent to the hexagons associated with the hexagons.

![[6 Senses#6 Senses]]

For example, the [[hexagon]]s that touch a pentagon should have properties of 
1. Aries: Sight + input & output of 5 other senses
2. Taurus: Hearing + input & output of 5 other senses
3. Gemini: Smell & Taste + input & output of 5 other senses
4. Cancer: Speech + input & output of 5 other senses
5. Leo: Touch + input & output of 5 other senses
6. Virgo: Thought + input & output of 5 other senses
7. Libra: Sight - input & output of 5 other senses
8. Scorpio: Hearing - input & output of 5 other senses
9. Sagittarius: Smell & Taste - input & output of 5 other senses
10. Capricorn: Speech - input & output of 5 other senses
11. Aquarius: Touch/Skin - input & output of 5 other senses
12. Pisces: Thought - input & output of 5 other senses

Example 1: 
- if a hexagon is touched by pentagon number 1, 2, and 3, then this hexagon should have Sight, Hearing, and Smell & Taste + input and output of Speech, Touch, and Thought.

Example 2:
- if a hexagon is touched by 1, 4, 11, then it should have Sight and Speech + inputs and Touch - input and output of 3 other senses.

Of course the Zodiacs with its assigned sense can be swapped around to best match the value that specific Zodiac represents. The layout of the pentagon or 12 zodiac should be such that 1 and 7 is on opposite side of the sphere or should never be adjacent (with one hexagon in between them). In other words, the + input of a sense should never be adjacent to a - input of the same sense.

Like such:

What should be the assignment of each hexagon's input and output when there is more than 20? I have not yet thought about in detail.
