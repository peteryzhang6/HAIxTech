# HAIxCore Inner Design

The core is consist of yin and yang.

The yin should be consist of non or less electrical conductive material or liquid metal for low voltage.

The yang should be consist of well electrical conductive material or liquid metal for high voltage.

The little yin and yang (鱼眼) should be a magnet or a device to provide rotation of the core when the core receives and outputs voltage.

One can also make changes accordingly to fit one's belief, such as changing the innermost Yin-Yang sphere to a Trinity and see how that goes.
# HAIxCore Outer Design

The idea is to divide the core's surface into 12 pentagon with 20 hexagons, like that of a soccer ball.
