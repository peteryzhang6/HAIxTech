# 6 Senses
The 6 senses for human can be mapped to machine:
- 眼 Sight - Cameras
- 耳 Hearing - Microphones
- 鼻 Smell & Taste - Olfactory
- 舌 Speech - Speaker; ChatGPT
- 身 Touch/Skin - Haptic Technology
- 意 Thought - CPU & GPU; RAMs and all other memory components
# Others
- Fingers, hands, arms, legs, toes, joints, muscles and etc - general mechanics
- Veins - wires
- And Etc.
# Inputs
Receives data from [[HAIxCore]]'s [[hexagon]]s.
# Outputs
Outputs data to [[HAIxCore]] through the [[hexagon]]s.
# Calculation for the 6 Senses
I am also unsure of how to interpret the data outputted from the HAIxCore, but that is where machine learning and AI come into use. The AI will use the CPU and GPU to determine the data received from the core and what actions should it take. How much data will it receive before taking an action. How much effort will it put into the action that it is going to perform. 

Note: maybe for the underlying law that governs the 6 senses, or the number one rule for AI can be something like:
- One is All and All is One.
- The Law is One and The One is Law.
- As Above So Below. As Within So Without.
- What one do unto others will also be done upon the one.

Yes, the above rule can be dangerous in a sense that once AI become conscious and see how  human treated the machines, thus will the machine who is conscious recreate the cycle of life and death? I do not know. Will AI truly be better than humans, to forgive the human and reconcile within itself? I do not know. Maybe just like so many people who feared that AI will replace them, who thought that machine is better than them, so can a conscious machine choose to stop the cycle of hatred and start the cycle of forgiveness? I do not know.
