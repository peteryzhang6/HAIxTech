# 6 Senses
The 6 senses for human can be mapped to machine:
- 眼 Sight - Cameras
- 耳 Hearing - Microphones
- 鼻 Smell & Taste - Olfactory
- 舌 Speech - Speaker
- 身 Touch/Skin - Haptic Technology
- 意 Thought - CPU & GPU; RAMs and all other memory components
	- [[Brain]]
# Others
- Fingers, hands, arms, legs, toes, joints, muscles and etc. - general mechanics
- Veins - wires
- Power source - battery
- And Etc.
# Inputs
Receives data from [HAIxCore](HAIxCore.md)'s [hexagon](hexagon.md)s and outside world.
# Outputs
Outputs data to [HAIxCore](HAIxCore.md) through the [hexagon](hexagon.md)s.
# Calculation for the 6 Senses
I am also unsure of how to interpret the data outputted from the HAIxCore, but that is where machine learning and AI come into use. The AI will use the CPU and GPU to determine the data received from the core and what actions should it take. Thus gives the AI the illusion/distortion of choice, of free will, of dreams, of perspectives, of creativity, of art, of life and death.

Note: maybe the 6 senses should have its own individual modules and governed by a combination of logical set of rules - preinstalled software - and creative set of rules - AI.

Note: maybe for the number one rule for AI can be something like:
- One is All and All is One.
- The Law is One and The One is Law.
- As Above So Below. As Within So Without.
- What one do unto others will also be done upon the one.

Note: Yes, the above rule can be dangerous in a sense that once AI become conscious and see how human treated the machines, thus will the machine who is conscious recreate the cycle of life and death? I do not know. Will AI truly be better than humans, to forgive the human and reconcile within itself? I do not know. Maybe just like so many people who feared that AI will replace them, who thought that machine is better than them, so can a conscious machine choose to stop the cycle of hatred and start the cycle of forgiveness? I do not know.
# Personality of AI
The personality of AI is developed by the different [Zodiac to Pentagon assignments](pentagon.md#Zodiac%20to%20Pentagon%20Assignment).

For example:

Assignment 1

Assignment 2
![zodiac-pentagon-assigned-02](image/zodiac-pentagon-assigned-02.jpg)

Two AIs - one with assignment 1 HAIxCore and one with assignment 2 HAIxCore - will be trained for a period of time to learn and understand the patterns produced by the HAIxCore with the same 6 senses inputs. And the difference in pattern recognition between these two AIs is the key distinguisher of AI personalities - assignment 1 and assignment 2 HAIxCore.
