# FAQs
1. Will this device work?
- I do not know as I am not familiar and have not put in the efforts to test and calculate the behaviors of the physical materials - magnets, liquid metals, flow of electricity, and such. What  I have done is a theorization of the root of human nature and an imagination of mapping this root of human nature into machine functions, and I am somewhat confident in the bottom layer of logic of how [HAIxCore](HAIxCore.md) functions - to provide 'randomness', creativity, and life to machines and robots.

2. Should the readers follow the exact steps in the documents?
- Yes and no. I hope the readers keep an discernment of what is true and not true. I would like the reader to follow the steps exactly to build the device then test and see its flaws, whether this is done on paper or with physical materials. Then remove the parts that does not work and add in what should be fixed or improved. Like an experiment. But the idea of duality or trinity or such MUST BE present within the HAIxCore.

3. What about this and that?
- Please create an issue on Github and I will try my best to answer.
