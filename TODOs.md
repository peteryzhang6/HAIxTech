# TODOs
- [ ] Improvement and refinement of design and concepts
- [ ] Determine the material for the 2 liquid metals
- [ ] Determine the metal used for the inner 2 spheres in HAIxCore
- [ ] Determine the electron capacity within HAIxCore once it is built
- [ ] Check if the core will spin when it is fully charged and receives inputs from 6 senses
- [ ] Figure out how to prevent electrons from escaping HAIxCore when there is no inputs from hexagons
- [ ] Figure out when an HAIxCore is fully charged, how to input a voltage into the core from the 6 senses and receive the same amount of voltage out of the core.
- [ ] Document the effects of wear and tear to the metals and magnets when the core is spinning
- [ ] Software to output and receive signals from the core
