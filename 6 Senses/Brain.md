# Brain
The central processing unit of human beings. 

It is divided into three core parts: the logical processing unit - left brain (CPU), the graphic processing unit - right brain (GPU), and the observing unit - pineal gland (AI).

To form the graphic or imaginary understanding, close the right eye and observe with the left eye.

To form the logical or calculated understanding, close the left eye and observe with the right eye.

To form the deciding factor or weighting the two choices between imaginary and real, use both eyes or pineal gland to observe the connection and relation of the imaginary and the real.

To understand the relation between and inner workings of left brain, right brain, and pineal gland, do I discover the infinity that lies beyond the trinity.
